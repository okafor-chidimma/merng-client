//cached value stores any in memory cache. what the cached values? apollo client saves all the return data from each query in the memory cache in a data normalization format meaning that it extracts object into their own table and replaces them with their id sort of like FK, PK situation. it only extracts these objects if we specifically returned id in our return object from the query sent in useQuery or useMutation.

/*
  if another query or mutation is sent and the return object matches a type as well as the id existing in cache, the apollo client just merges the incoming with the existing data. 

  if there are properties in the new object already existing in the obj stored in cache, it overwrites the properties while fields that exist in either new or existing are preserved
